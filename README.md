# ONLINE WEB 3.0 CHESS-APP

This code repository contains an app where you can play chess offline and also online by sharing the game's link. The upcoming updates will let you bet using crypto for each game and also play with a chess bot. 
For now I have implemented transfer of crypto by connecting metamask accounts. This is still an unfinished project so chill out!

## Home Page

As soon as you enter the website you would get a pop-up from metamask asking you to connect your wallet to the app. If you don't have metamask then you can create an account and download 
metamask from chrome web store.
